## Topic

AI Search, Relevance Engineering, and the Future of SEO Tools


## Why Selected

This video was selected because Mike King explains, in his own words, why SEO tools and practices have fallen years behind how Google's AI-driven search actually works, and introduces "relevance engineering" as the discipline he believes should replace traditional SEO.


# Key Points From Mike King's Interview


## 1. SEO tools are roughly 10 years behind how search works

Mike explains that Google moved beyond simple keyword/lexical matching a decade ago, yet most SEO software still measures keyword presence and link counts the same way it always has.

### Research Insight

There is a structural gap between what SEO tools report and what actually drives visibility today, meaning practitioners may be optimizing for signals that no longer matter as much.


---


## 2. AI Overviews and AI Mode work through "query fan-out," not rankings

Mike describes how Google expands a single user query into many related queries behind the scenes, pulls content chunks from various pages, and feeds them to its AI model to generate a synthesized answer.

### Research Insight

A page can contribute to an AI answer without ever ranking highly for the original query, which means traditional rank-tracking can give a misleading picture of what is actually working.


---


## 3. Search has always been a branding channel, just unmeasured as one

Mike argues that when users get an answer directly from an AI Overview without clicking through, that still counts as a meaningful brand impression, similar to a display ad or a Super Bowl spot.

### Research Insight

SEO value may need to be reframed around brand visibility and mindshare rather than click-through traffic alone, especially as fewer answers require a click.


---


## 4. "Relevance engineering" as a proposed replacement for SEO

Mike positions himself as "chief relevance engineer" and argues the industry needs to rebuild its practices around testing and engineering rather than repeating unverified best practices.

### Research Insight

He specifically calls out the "60-70 character title tag" rule as an example of an industry myth that persisted despite no longer being accurate, illustrating how outdated assumptions get passed around unchallenged.


---


## 5. Frustration with Google's lack of transparency on AI-driven behavior change

Mike expresses concern that Google hasn't clearly communicated to the industry that AI Overviews are reducing click-through rates, leaving SEOs to explain declining traffic to clients without official backing.

### Research Insight

This creates a credibility problem for SEO professionals, who must justify changing performance metrics without authoritative guidance from the platform itself.


---


# Pros Mentioned / Observed From The Video


## 1. Pushes the industry toward technical accuracy

Mike challenges long-standing SEO assumptions and pushes for testing and verification instead of repeating unproven rules.


## 2. Identifies new sources of value beyond clicks

Frames brand visibility, mentions, and mindshare as legitimate, measurable forms of value in an AI-driven search landscape.


## 3. Treats industry disruption as an opportunity

Sees the uncertainty around AI search as a chance to define new practices, rather than something to fear.


---


# Cons / Challenges Mentioned / Observed From The Video


## 1. Lack of mature tooling

Mike states that current SEO software hasn't adapted to how AI Overviews and AI Mode actually retrieve and generate answers.


## 2. Harder to prove value to clients

Without official guidance from Google on how AI is changing click behavior, SEOs must independently convince clients that declining traffic isn't a failure.


## 3. Requires more technical sophistication

Understanding concepts like query fan-out and embedding-based content scoring requires deeper technical knowledge than traditional keyword-based SEO.

Hey everybody, uh Danny Goodwin,
editorial director of Search Engine Land
here and I am being joined today by none
other than Mike King. Uh Mike, I feel
like everybody also uh everybody in the
world probably knows you at this point
in the SEO world, but if you want to
give yourself a brief introduction of
who you are and what you do. Sure. I'm
Mike King, uh, CEO and founder of Iple
Rank, also chief relevance engineer. Uh,
I've been doing SEO for far too long. I
also have a background in computer
science and we do a lot of enterprise
SEO. Awesome. And you just had your
first SEO week conference. I was kind of
curious how you thought that went and
sort of what was what was the overall
themes or takeaways that you think came
out of that?
Yeah, I think it's really interesting
because we kind of positioned it as the
uh next chapter of search and a lot of
the things that we talked about were
things that ultimately got announced
yesterday at Google IO. So, um, you
know, it it it was kind of indicative of
like us just being slightly ahead of the
curve with the conference and, um, you
know, the feedback, and I'm I'm not
being hyperbolic here, but a lot of
people said it was the best SEO
conference they've ever been to. So, I'm
really happy with how that turned out.
I'm really happy with how all our
speakers showed up and yeah, excited to
do it again next year. Awesome. And I
feel like I should take this opportunity
to before we dive into what I wanted to
talk to you about today is kind of the
state of SEO, but we're just about I
think at the year anniversary of the the
leak from last year. I was just kind of
curious if you know looking back on it
uh any thoughts on how that kind of
helped the industry or did it not help
as much as you thought it did? What's
kind of your your look back? Like what
what are you thinking about it a year
later?
I think our industry is really stuck in
this kind of like cognitive dissonance
where like when they get new information
they just say oh we already knew that
and it's like a way for them to navigate
the fear of you know things changing
right so I don't think enough things
have changed right like I think that all
that information effectively gave us a
lot of telemetry of how search works and
you would expect that at the very least
our software companies would
adopting more of that and surfacing more
of that data for us so that we can be
more effective in our jobs. But I do
believe that there is like, you know, a
certain subset of the community that
that did absolutely do that. Like I'm
seeing a lot of people that are pulling
those metrics and using that to build
like their own sort of correlation
studies. There's a guy named Monik Bond
from um a company called Search Atlas
that spoke at SEO week and he walked
through like here are all the things
that we're doing. Here are the metrics
that we built on the back of that. Um,
you know, one of the things that we do a
lot of is using that uh site focus score
idea and using embeddings to represent
the whole site and then seeing like what
is the distance for a given page from
like the the overarching site embedding
and then if anything is too far away, we
just delete that content. And every time
we've done it, we've seen, you know, the
whole site perform better. So, it's
shocking to me that we don't have, you
know, like content auditing tools that
automatically do this sort of stuff.
And, um, you know, I I got an email from
the Screaming Frog team the other day
and they are starting to incorporate
stuff like this. And you know, it's it's
interesting to see that like they are
always the company that's like the most
agile and and updating their software in
this way and then reluctantly the rest
of the SEO space starts to uh copy what
they do over time. But it's been really
slowgoing on that like upper level of
the SEO space. But I think that there
are more and more people that are like
me that are incorporating this sort of
stuff into their analyses. Awesome. All
right. Um, so yeah, let's dive into a
little bit of the state of SEO uh today.
What do you think uh and this may just
sort of reiterate what you were just
saying, but overall as an industry, what
do you think that a lot of us are doing
right when it when it comes to adapting
to all these AI changes and what are we
doing wrong as well?
I I think we're doing the exact wrong
thing as it relates to like adapting
here because again going back to the
software companies, they're not
fundamentally changing. They're just
throwing chat GPT on the top of their
service. So, you know, it when I left
Google IO yesterday, I felt really
um it felt like the idea of like logging
into one of these tools is just
completely futile at this point because
it's such a disconnect between what
Google does and what SEO software does.
Like at the very least, we're like 10
years behind, right? And that's not
again being hyperbolic. It's this idea
that Google moved beyond the lexical
model of search 10 years ago and all of
our tools are still just counting the
presence and distribution rates of words
and saying like hey use these words more
or we're looking at the link graph in a
way that is you know like a um very
small approximation of what Google is
doing but we learned from the leak and
also we learned a lot of things from the
the DOJ just DOJ antitrust trial
documents. We've learned a lot from the
exploit uh where we can see all the IR
metrics and things like that. But uh at
the very least, we've learned that, you
know, where your where the pages that
link to you sit in the different levels
of the index impact how much authority
that they pass. But every link index is
still using the same metrics that they
were using, you know, for the last 15
years.
So we're what we have to use to do our
job doesn't make sense at this point.
And then also a lot of
um you know where Google is going as far
as like AI mode, AI overviews, we don't
have the ability to do what they're
doing. And to some degree it's it's not
really possible, right? like they have
this idea that they call query fan out
where effectively they're doing query
expansion based on what the user put in
and they're doing it in a way where
they're just handing it the query off to
Gemini 2.5 Pro like a customized version
of it and it's then returning a bunch of
queries and also different data points
from like you know the knowledge graph
and so on and so forth and then it's
performing all these searches in the
background and then it's pulling chunks
from those pages and then feeding
to Gemini to then generate um you know
what the response is going to be in AI
mode. So we have nothing that does
anything like that. And in fact like I
before I jumped on this call with you I
was literally like coding a version of
what this could look like so I can have
something we can point to to get like a
a place to start. But there's numerous
keyword research tools out there and
none of them have jumped on this idea.
Even even when you read other people's
blog posts, and when I say other people,
I mean not mine about how to optimize
for AI overviews, they're still just
saying like, "Oh yeah, look up what
ranks for that that query and then, you
know, do your optimizations." And it's
real hand wavy like do your
optimizations, right? Um, the way that
AI overviews works is also using this
query fan out idea. And so where we got
things wrong, I think as an industry is
that we initially looked at these AI
overview results and we saw like, oh
well, something that ranks you like
number
52 is being considered
um for this AI overview. That's not
necessarily what was happening. What was
happening was that document may have
ranked number three for one of these
expanded queries, but we just can't see
that. And
so what we're doing is just completely
out of phase with what Google is doing.
And the problem is is that you still get
some level of results. And so people are
like happy just to continue to go with
the best practices, but frankly most of
our industry does not know what it's
doing right now. Yeah. And obviously you
just mentioned AI mode and AI overviews
which are not rankings, they are
citations and kind of synthesized
answers. So that's been one of my
questions I've been having too is how do
SEOs continue to provide value heading
forward in this new landscape like
beyond rankings which is what you know a
lot of people have sort of based their
whole business around is like I can get
you ranked number one on Google. So
where's our value heading forward? Do
you do you see it? Yeah, I think the
channel has fundamentally changed and as
a result of that the user behavior has
fundamentally changed. And so what I'm
realizing is that search has always been
a branding channel. We've never
positioned it that way because it's
always been considered like, oh,
performance, we drive traffic, we drive
clicks. But with more of these surfaces
that are popping up, like whether it's
featured snippets or AI overviews or AI
mode, there's a lot of instances where
the user doesn't have to click to take
an action, right? Like if you look up a
query that's like, you know, um, best
earbuds for working out and you see in
the AI overview like, oh, Apple AirPods,
cool. You don't have to click through
for that. You can go to the store and
buy the Apple AirPods. But we've never
taken credit for that because we look at
channels like Display that have like
zero click or
0001% click-through rate and we're like,
that's not real. that doesn't do
anything. But the reality is that
branding channels do a lot. Um, running
YouTube ads or or running a Super Bowl
ad that creates search volume. So,
what's happening here is that, you know,
you might type in a non-branded query
and then you see some branded
information and you take action or you
see some branded information and that
informs the subsequent query that you're
going to run and then take action. So, I
think what we need to be doing is a more
strategic thing where we're we're
leaning more into the branding aspect of
the channel and then showcasing for
clients like, hey, this is a way that we
can help you change the mind share, not
just how do we drive clicks for you?
Because the reality is that people are
getting their information directly from
the SER. And again, that is a valuable
thing. But what we're ultimately seeing
is that when they do click, it is a more
qualified user because they're more
educated. So we have to explain to
clients that you know the the
relationship between um clicks,
impressions and conversions has changed
a bit. And you know in a lot of cases we
see that like you know conversions may
be going up even though traffic is going
down. But nevertheless all of this is a
strategic discussion that we need to be
having. And the problem is that SEO is
historically not good at being
strategic.
Yes. So, uh, obviously you mentioned
you've been around for far too long in
the industry, like a lot of us at this
point. Is there anything that's exciting
you at this point about SEO in in the
future?
Yeah, it it's all very exciting because
we're in a space where like we're
changing things. So, we've got to invent
things, we got to research things, we
got to find out, you know, what actually
works now. So, it's a lot of fun to play
around with these things. And also just
the the technology is is marvelous, you
know? I mean, there's like the the the
new aspects that they're adding to
Google search are mindblowing, right?
Like the fact that we're talking about
personal context, we're talking about
reasoning. We're talking about deep
search. We're talking about all these
new things that like allow us to get
directly to these answers. We're talking
about the multimodality
uh aspect of it where you can like bring
in videos and very much understand it or
um the information can only be in
Japanese but they're going to tra
translate it into English and give it to
me. Like all of this is amazing. And so
figuring out where we fit in this again
for so many people is like a fearful
endeavor, but to me it's exciting
because it's like we have the
opportunity to define something new. And
again, this is where my problem comes
with um the SEO community is that so
many people are just saying like, "Oh,
it's just SEO. It's just SEO." M and you
know where they're correct is that yes
the fundamentals still need to be here.
You still need to have a techn
technically you know solid website
that's accessible. You've got to have
the content. You've got to um you know
make sure your 301 redirects are in
place, all that sort of stuff. But the
big difference is that what they do with
our inputs is dramatically different.
And so we don't have the control that we
did before. Like you put something into
Google before, it comes out the same on
the other side. Now it is enhanced. It
is chopped and screwed and then it's
like served up to the user in a way
that's
unrecognizable and you don't know if
it's going to be your site or someone
else's site that shows up there when you
have the same information. So I I think
that is a fundamental difference on how
we need to be
operating but we don't have enough
visibility into what we need to be doing
to operate that way and the way we get
that isn't through optimization it's
through engineering.
All right, awesome. And on the other
end, as you alluded to, there are some
fearful people uh at this moment of all
the changes that are going on,
especially with IO, is there anything
right now in the SEO world that is sort
of keeping you up at night? Does
anything have you worried uh about the
impact of all these AI changes, AI
overview, zero click, all all of this
stuff that's happening right now? Is
there anything that has you concerned?
My only concern is
is the lack of information from Google
about the search behavior changes. Um,
you know, I think, and I said this to,
you know, some engineers and Danny
Sullivan and so on, um, that what would
have been super valuable would have been
them to add something to like the how
Google works um, section of the site
that talks about like, hey, AI overviews
is shifting user behavior. um you know,
you should expect that there will be
less clicks cuz without that, what we've
had to do as a community is tell our
clients that and prove it and prove it
and prove it. And after, you know, 25
years of of being measured on traffic,
which we can argue was right or wrong,
um we're now telling them that they
should expect less traffic. So we don't
have, you know, credibility to establish
that. We needed Google's support on
that. And I think that's especially
um disheartening because, you know, our
relationship with Google is symbiotic,
right? Like Google's search quality
would not be anywhere near as good if it
wasn't for us. Um they wanted structured
data. Cool. So we pushed schema. They
wanted uh sites to go secure, so we
pushed that. They wanted core web vital
so they can make the web faster and save
money in crawling and so on. We gave
them that. They can't give us something
as small as like, hey, things are
changing. Here's a document that you can
give to your clients so they can have
their expectations managed. That's
preposterous. And I don't think that the
relationship that we have with Google is
healthy, right? Like if you look at
Google IO is a good example, right? like
they they are they are supporting the
development community because and it's
not an altruistic thing. It's obviously
so that you know people use their
products and pay for Google Cloud and so
on, but there's also this aspect that
they give a lot to the open- source
community because they're going to get a
lot back from the open- source
community. And so they have this huge
event that costs, you know, probably
1020 million where they're really like
taking care of these people. And then
for us, they put us in these side rooms
and they give us some soda and some
chips and they say, "Cool, here's what
it is. Take take it or leave it." um you
know that that's
not that's not a good way to manage a
relationship with the people that you
need. So that's my big thing. It's
really just like we deserved more
support in this moment.
Well
said. All right. So we've said a lot. So
just to kind of sum up based on what
you're seeing right now, do you think
SEO is heading toward a period of
growth, decline, or reinvention over the
next, you pick a time frame, next year,
couple years, five years? It needs to be
reinvention. And I think what's going to
happen is is it's going to split to some
degree. And I think I'm driving the
split, right? Because what I'm saying is
that we need to reinvent ourselves. And
that reinvention I'm calling re is
relevance engineering. Mhm. And um
because like the SEO frame is so
limiting um you know SEO has like a
awful reputation. There's like a recent
study about a year ago where they proved
through a longitudinal study that you
know SEO has made Google worse. Um
there's no standards in SEO and you talk
to 10 SEOs and ask them what they do,
you're going to get 10 different answers
of like how to do an audit, how to do
anything, right? And so I think we need
to frankly grow up and um come to terms
with this environment that we're in and
we need to be building like open-source
software to support this because you
know the SEO software industrial complex
is not giving us what we need to do the
job as it is today or how it's going to
be you know in a couple months from now.
So, I think that there are going to be
people pe be people that cling to what
SEO has been for the last 25 years and
continue to lean on best practices and
continue to only make changes when they
read a blog post or when Google tells
them to do something different. But I
think that, you know, this new thing
needs to define what it is for itself.
like SEO has largely been defined by
Google and it's been such a disservice
because they tell us not to do certain
things so we don't but the real
opportunities often lie in the things
they tell us not to do you know as an
example like and I don't mean just them
I also mean like within our own
community as an example our own
community has continued to say that you
know page titles should only be 60 70
characters that's not true. It's 100%
not true. Like they weigh everything
that is in that page title and in some
cases they will use parts of it to
rewrite the page title based on the
user's query. So but despite that being
like an actual fact that you can
experiment and see and in fact uh you
know Google spokespeople have said like
where did that even come from? We never
said 60 70 characters.
So, we have all these things that don't
make sense but have this like, you know,
perpetual
um inertia because so many people said
they were true and that stuff has no
place in this environment that is so
volatile and um you know just needs like
new information to capitalize on where
we're going. So, you're going to have
this mindset that continues to persist
because it just will. But then you're
going to have this other set of people
that are going to be like, "No, let's
test everything. Let's try and build
things that replicate what Google is
doing. um let's let's
like pay attention to what's happening
uh in all the research that Google is
sharing and let's actually make this a
thing that is like more scientific.
Awesome. All right. And speaking I heard
you mention the term relevance
engineering. I know that's going to be
part of your talk at SMX Advance which
is coming up June 11th to 13th in
Boston. We are back live in person which
is awesome. I think you've spoken at a
few advances in your day in person. Yes,
absolutely. So, it's great to have you
back for that. And yeah, if you just
want to give people who are thinking
about going like why should they come to
your session? Because I'm the greatest
SEO speaker there is.
Duh. Just kidding. Um, no, I'm going to
walk through like the tenants of
everything that I'm talking about. I'm
going to make the case like very clearly
like here's where we're at. Here's
what's going on. here's what the changes
that we're not ready for and here's what
we need to do to get ready and stay
viable in this space. So, we're going to
be thinking strategically about it, but
I'm also going to give you like tactics
and tools and, you know, things to
really learn so that you can level up to
um maintain and grow and thrive through
this next era of search. Awesome. I
can't wait for that. Um, it's going to
be one of the the sessions I'll be
moderating. So, I'm looking very forward
to that. So, Mike, thank you so much for
spending a little bit of time with us
and sharing your insights. It's always
awesome to hear from you. Um, and I I
sincerely hope a lot of people start
really listening to you and following
the direction because I think you have
uh you're right, spot on. So, thank you.
Yes. So, thanks again for joining us.
Uh, thanks everybody for watching.

# Research Observation

Mike King's framing from the video:

Identify how Google's AI search systems actually retrieve and synthesize answers (query fan-out, embeddings) → Reject outdated SEO assumptions that no longer hold → Reframe SEO as "relevance engineering," focused on testing and technical understanding → Treat brand visibility and mindshare, not just clicks, as the new measure of value
